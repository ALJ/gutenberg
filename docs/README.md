# Block Editor Handbook

**Gutenberg** is the project that is revolutionizing the building and publishing experience for WordPress, as Johannes Gutenberg did the printed word.

With the release of WordPress 5.9, the project is finishing the second phase of a four-phase process that will touch every piece of WordPress. The first phase was the introduction of blocks to the Post and Page editors. The second phase is **Customization** (which includes Full Site Editing, Block Patterns, Block Directory and Block based themes. The next two phases are Collaboration, and Multilingual.

Note: Though as it is software, even though a phase is "complete" refinements and improvements will always continue, so they truly are never complete.

See this preview video for WordPress 5.9 that shows off some of the great features from the Gutenberg project:

## Overview

Using a system of Blocks to compose and format content the editors are designed to create rich, flexible layouts for posts, pages, websites and digital products. Content is created in the unit of blocks instead of freeform text with inserted media, embeds and obscure shortcodes.

Blocks treat Paragraphs, Headings, Media, and Embeds all as components that, when strung together, make up the content stored in the WordPress database, replacing the traditional unknown blob of markup from posts to theme templates.

Blocks offer a unified experienced providing the same set of design and format tools for editing posts to building theme templtes. These visual tools offer an easier experience to building richer media, using drag-and-drop, modern color and layout interfaces.

Gutenberg aims to simplify creationg for authors and developers: allowing for greater reusability using blocks, patterns, and standard settings; enablign greater extendability with new APIs, hooks that can modify and extend the editor through custom blocks, styles and plugins.

For writers and creators, [learn to use the block editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/) to create media-rich posts and pages.

## Quick links for developers

The new block editors offer various ways for developers to extend and customize.

### Blocks

The block is the basic building component of Gutenberg [learn how to create your first block](/docs/getting-started/create-block/README.md). From setting up your development environment, tools, and getting comfortable with the new development model, this tutorial covers what you need to know to get started.

Learn to [create block patterns](/docs/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns.md) by combining together multiple blocks into reusable units that can insert into posts.

[Introduced in WordPress 5.8](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/25/introducing-theme-json-in-wordpress-5-8/), settings and styles bring finer-grain control over managing, colors, layout, typography and more. [Learn about theme.json](/docs/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json.md) and everything it can do.

New in WordPress 5.9, block themes bring blocks to the rest of your site by allowing you to [create theme templates using blocks](/docs/how-to-guides/themes/README.md).

### Develop for the block editor

Whether you want to extend the functionality of the block editor, or create a plugin based on it, [see the developer documentation](/docs/how-to-guides/README.md) to find all the information about the basic concepts you need to get started, the block editor APIs and its architecture.
